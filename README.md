I am really interested in a Resource Based Ecomomy (RBE) on Ethereum (ETH). This is a link-collection that collects links on this topic.

If you have more links or other info on RBE on ETH - please let me know and I will add this here. Also really interested in the intersection of UBI and RBE - where the UBI is calculated based on the available resources.
